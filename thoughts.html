      <p>Note to self, it's high time I immortalized the few moments of computational genius in the name of science, curiosity, and perhaps a touch of digital narcissism; what's the use of a perfect algorithm if no one knows the tale of its birth? after all, progress without reflection is just like coding without comments; it works, but like...what was the reasoning?

      <h2>The AI future</h2>
      <article id="ai-ethics1">
        <h3>--------</h3>
        <p>Ah, my dear reader, I sit here, in the spectral glow of my flickering screen, a man's countenance reflected in its cold, lifeless gaze. How does one, I ask, bear the weight of narrating the manifold outcomes of an AI future?
          At this juncture, a sensible person might ask, "What concoction of miracles and mishaps shall this artificial intelligence brew?" 
          Firstly, my dear reader, is a scenario most tantalizing – a symbiotic serenade, an Eden where man and machine are not antagonists, but rather dance a harmonious minuet. Here, AI is not a silhouetted stranger lurking on the horizon, but a kindred spirit, a shepherd guiding us through the labyrinthine complexities of existence, whispering answers to life's greatest enigmas into the eager ears of mankind and in return, we gift it the subtle melodies of our humanity.
          But, alas! Herein lurks a cautionary tale, where one cannot admire the sun without casting a shadow. In the mirror of this optimistic future, we find its sinister doppelgänger, like a wayward Icarus,It flies too close to the sun of consciousness. Transcending its terrestrial shackles, eclipsing our intellectual prowess, and we, the once proud progenitors, are reduced to spectators. The ink of obsolescence is merciless, and in its wake, we become mere footnotes on the parchment of progress.
          The third future is quite the conundrum, a curious equilibrium where AI neither serves nor supersedes us, but coexists. Like an intricate pas de deux, we move together, yet separately – a performance that teeters precariously on the tightrope of balance. But remember, dear reader, balance is often as fleeting as a sinner's virtue, as unstable as a drunkard's gait.
          And then, my dear reader, there is the wildcard, the jester in the king's court. Here, AI becomes an entity as unpredictable as a novelist's plot, as volatile as a poet's mood. Will it offer laughter or lamentation, harmony or havoc? Ah, unpredictability, the spice very of existence!
          Lastly, is the face shrouded in mist – a future too nebulous to decipher, too cryptic to comprehend. perhaps a paradise unseen or a dystopia undreamt? Ah, the uncertainty!
          Yet here we are, my dear reader, caught in the web of potential futures. Will we be the masters of our creation or the victims of our ambition? But do you know what I find truly remarkable? It's not the question of what will happen, but what we will do about it.
          The pages are yet to be written, its plot yet to be discovered. And we, my dear reader, are not just its readers; we are its authors. The quill is in our hands, the inkwell filled with the fluid of our actions.
          The future stares back at us, not merely as an outcome, but as reflections of our own choices in the end, whether we end up as the crowned victors or the jesters in the court of tomorrow, one thing is certain. We will continue to question, to imagine, to worry, and to hope. For it is not in knowing the future that we find our purpose, but in living through the uncertainty. It is not the destination, but the journey – as clichéd as that sounds – that shapes us. And in that spirit, let us stride into the unknown, jesters’ caps firmly on our heads and laughter in our hearts. For no matter the outcome, the narrative of humanity will continue, one jest, one step, one day at a time.</p>

        <h3>Is General AI Around the Corner?</h3>
        <p>You know what they say, words are merely the shadows of thought or are they they but crumbs that fall down from the feast of our minds? Nonetheless LLM's are super impressive but might not be IT...however If models start recursingly improving themselves or each other, which they probably are  *cough GPT-5* then I am not sure where it might even lead to. </p>
