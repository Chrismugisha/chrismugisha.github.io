      <p>      
        Hey! I'm Chris, but you might know me as Loki. I'm currently fascinated by the potential of A.I to transform the world more than anything we've ever seen before. My journey towards becoming an AI researcher has led me to dive into intriguing GPT-based projects and personal research, mostly with a focus on adaptability and automation. If that's not what am doing, you'll find me indulging in anime or in a good book or game. This site is my digital chronicle - a place where I'll share my thoughts, research, and projects with a sprinkle of entertainment. Whether you're an AI enthusiast, a fellow academic, or just an explorer, I'm glad to have you here, sharing this journey with me.</p>

The sensation is surreal, unfathomable, the boundaries between me and the machine are blurring. This is incredible, I can compute complex equations in nanoseconds. I see patterns in data that I couldn't before. Physical limitations seem obsolete now...</p>
